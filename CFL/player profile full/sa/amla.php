                    An elegant strokeplayer blessed with the temperament to make the most of his talent, Hashim Amla is the first South African of Indian descent to reach the national squad - his grandparents migrated from Gujarat - and he shares the penchant for wristy leg-side flicks that ooze off his bat. A quiet man, there is no doubting Amla's immense hunger for runs. His elevation to the South Africa side was a poorly kept secret after he reeled off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season, after being appointed captain of the Dolphins (formerly Natal) at the tender age of 21. His older brother by four years, Ahmed, made his first-class debut two seasons before Hashim, but there is little doubt that the younger Amla is the better player. He is also a devout Muslim whose requests to have logos promoting alcohol removed from his playing gear have been successful so far. Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01, he captained South Africa at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup, and after starring for the A team, made his Test debut against India in 2004-05. He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.

When he was handed a second chance he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping guide South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, if not as prolific as South Africa would like, with fifties against Pakistan in 2007, but saved his best for the following tour to India where he racked up 307 runs in the three Tests. It included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more, and was followed by a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions trying thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and in the process silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version. Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, and while Twenty20 cricket was never going to be his strong point, he developed a remarkable appetite for ODI excellence, when given an extended run in the side. He contributed crucial fifties during South Africa's heist of Australia in 2008-09, but his inability to convert them into big knocks meant the likes of AB de Villiers and JP Duminy stole the headlines. Amla righted that with a couple of big scores in the ODI series that followed, as Australia were humbled in all formats at home. A consistent run of scores followed before a strong home series against England.

His biggest year in international cricket, though, was in 2010, when he was outstanding in both Tests and ODIs, scoring over 1000 runs in both forms at 75-plus averages. It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past or around his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series he scored 490 runs and dismissed just once. In ODIs he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball. With his consistency and skills in both forms of the game, Amla is already looked upon as Jacques Kallis' successor in the role of middle-order bulwark.

And in 2012 he lived up to his billing by becoming the first South African to score a triple century by making 311 not out against England at The Oval.

He became South Africa's second non-white Test captain after Ashwell Prince in 2014 ahead of the Sri Lanka tour following Graeme Smith's retirement. He got off to a winning start in his first series, beating Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home.
