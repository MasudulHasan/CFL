                    As a young man Michael Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he has matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players, and has been entrusted with the task of leading the Test team out of a trough. Clarke learned a year into his Test career that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but he is now a calculated player who is his country's most effective run-maker in the five-day game.

While he could clear boundaries and loft regular fours as a youngster, Clarke's main modern method is to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground, although he will pull off the front foot when settled. In Tests he has the potential to develop into a master by the end of his career, having taken over the team's No.1 rating from Ricky Ponting in 2009, even though he has batted at five in most appearances. At one-day level he is extremely accomplished and a highly valued member, but in Twenty20 a lack of power stands out.

Since Shane Warne, Clarke has been Australia's A-list cricketer, a boy from Sydney's working-class west who became a celebrity thanks to his ready smile, large endorsements and a high-profile engagement to a model. After the relationship broke down early in 2010, Clarke displayed his impressive ability to compartmentalise his life by scoring a hundred at his first chance in New Zealand. Proving he could deal with such a taxing situation and retain a clear head in the middle is one reason why he took over from Ponting as Test captain.

In the field Clarke's throw is as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he can winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin. Mostly he is known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. The next step towards fulfilment is to prove his skills as a leader, and continue to enhance reputation as a high-class, consistent batsman.
