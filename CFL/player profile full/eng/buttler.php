                   Jos Buttler is one of the coming generation upon whom England have pinned their hopes, not just as a wicketkeeper-batsman in one-day cricket where his cool-eyed, innovative hitting brings excitement to England's middle order, but also in Test cricket where he spent 2014 as the successor to Matt Prior behind the stumps. His wicket-keeping remains a work in progress, but England are so excited by his batting potential that they have every given every indication that they are committed to his fulfilling the role long term.

England have gradually expanded his range: his international career began in T20, developed into 50 overs and, finally, in a home series against India in 2014, he proved that his game was developing calmer shades as he won a Test place. He made an immediate impact on his debut Test innings, striking 85 against India in Southampton in 2014, riding his luck at times but producing one of England's most exciting innings of the summer.

Buttler shot to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey.

He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. His breakthrough innings came against South Africa at Edgbaston, with a blistering 32 off 10 balls.

After a successful Lions tour of Sri Lanka in early 2012, Buttler was given his ODI debut against Pakistan in the UAE, though had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper and when Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India.

With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future.

England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound - hitting a return catch to Ravi Rampaul in the final over - and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first ODI hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed England run chase virtually single handedly. When Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble, the selectors gambled by throwing him into the Test team. By now, his talent was so apparent any wicketkeeping blemishes were looked on kindly.
